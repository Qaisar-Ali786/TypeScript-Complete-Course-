<!-- What is typescript? -->
<!-- typescript is a programming language developed by microsoft. it is superset of javascript
which means every valid javascript code is actually a valid typescript. the main difference is
typescript add types and extra features that javascript does't have natively. -->

<!-- to install typescript go the the official page of typescript which is //typescriptlang.org//
to check whether typescript is installed or not command //tsc -v// -->

<!-- you have to install node js of any version -->
<!-- node -v to check the version of node js after installation -->

<!-- Globally Installing TypeScript
It can be handy to have TypeScript available across all projects, often to test one-off ideas. Long-term, codebases should prefer a project-wide installation over a global install so that they can benefit from reproducible builds across different machines.
via npm
You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
To do this, run //npm install -g typescript.// This will install the latest version (currently 5.9). -->
<!-- npm i -g ts-node you also have to install ts-node pade -->

<!-- after that you have to install  extensions first javascript and typescript nightly -->
<!-- than install another extension that is code runner -->

<!-- to show the result of console in the terminal
npm install -g tsx
than run command
tsx filename.ts
-->
